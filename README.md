## Landing page

The marketing landing page lives in [`apps/landing/`](apps/landing/README.md) (Astro + Tailwind, deployed to Vercel).

## Install

### Download

Download the latest `.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/bartekczyz/claude-profiles/releases/latest). Open it, drag `claude-profiles.app` to `/Applications`. Launch.

### Build from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bartekczyz/claude-profiles.git
cd claude-profiles
pnpm install
pnpm --filter claude-profiles tauri build
```

The `.dmg` lands in `apps/claude-profiles/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/dmg/`. macOS will warn on first launch because the local build isn't notarized — right-click the `.app` → Open → Open to bypass Gatekeeper.

## Using claude-profiles

Create a profile from the sidebar — give it a name, pick a colour, and choose which surfaces you want (desktop app, CLI, or both). The app generates everything you need on the spot:

- **Desktop app.** A `Claude (<Name>).app` launcher lands in `/Applications`. Double-click to open Claude Desktop with that profile's account, history, and settings. Spotlight, Launchpad, Finder, and ⌘-Tab all see it as its own app, tinted with the profile colour.
- **Claude Code CLI.** A `claude-<slug>` command appears on your `PATH`. Run `claude-work` (or whatever slug you picked) in any terminal to start Claude Code with that profile's config and login. Each profile keeps its own session and credentials.

Switch profiles from the sidebar, with ⌘1..⌘9 to jump to a slot, ⌘F to filter the list, or ⌘K to open the command palette. ⌘N creates a new profile, ⌘, opens Settings.

Already using Claude Desktop or Claude Code? On first launch the app offers to import your existing setup into your first profile — no re-login required. You can rerun this later from Settings → Data → "Detect and import…".

Deleting a profile from its detail view removes the launcher and CLI wrapper; the profile's data either goes to the Trash or is deleted outright, your choice.

## FAQ

**Why do I have to log in to Claude Code again after importing my existing install?**
The Keychain service name is derived from your `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, which changes when you move into a per-profile directory. The credentials don't carry over. You only need to log in once per profile.

**Why does the Dock show Claude's regular icon instead of my profile's color?**
The launcher `.app` immediately execs the real Claude.app, so the running Dock icon belongs to Claude. The custom color shows up in Spotlight, Finder, Launchpad, and Cmd-Tab — anywhere the launcher itself is referenced. We're tracking better Dock-icon options for v1.1.

**My new profile launcher doesn't open as `claude-<slug>` from my terminal.**
`~/.local/bin` isn't on your PATH. Open Settings → System and click "Install / re-install hook", or add the line manually to your `.zshrc` / `.bashrc` / `config.fish`. Open a new terminal to pick up the change.

**Does this send any of my data anywhere?**
No. The app is local-only and has no analytics, no telemetry, no remote logging. Auto-update checks the GitHub Releases manifest and that's the only outbound request.

**Can I migrate later if I skipped the first-run prompt?**
Yes — Settings → Data → "Detect and import…".

**Is this safe? What about my Keychain credentials?**
Each profile gets a separate Keychain entry derived from its config directory. We don't read or copy your credentials; Claude Code handles all of that. The CLI isolation behavior depends on undocumented Claude Code internals (its SHA-256 service-name derivation), and could break in a future Claude Code release. If it does we'll patch.

**Why "Settings" instead of "Preferences"?**
macOS deprecated "Preferences" in favor of "Settings" in Ventura. We follow the current convention.

## Acknowledgements

claude-profiles is inspired by [Multi-Claude](https://multiclaude.app/), a paid macOS app that pioneered the `--user-data-dir` profile-wrapper approach for Claude Desktop. claude-profiles extends the idea to the Claude Code CLI and ships free + open-source.
