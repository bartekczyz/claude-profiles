/**
 * Sortable wrapper around the sidebar row.
 *
 * Renders the plain `SidebarProfileRow` unchanged — so the two variants stay
 * pixel-identical — and adds a grip handle (Lucide `grip-vertical`) that owns
 * the drag listeners. The grip sits in the row's leading column, on top of the
 * app glyph, which fades out while the grip is showing; a dedicated gutter
 * would cost the width the profile names need at 200px.
 *
 * The row itself stays a click target — dnd-kit's pointer sensor uses an
 * activation-distance threshold so a normal click never accidentally starts a
 * drag.
 *
 * Keyboard reorder lands via dnd-kit's KeyboardSensor (Space to grab, arrows
 * to move, Space/Enter to drop, Esc to cancel) — the grip button is the focus
 * target, and focusing anywhere in the row reveals it.
 */
// Animate the *during-drag* shuffle (siblings sliding to make room) but
// skip the *post-drop* layout-change animation. Our optimistic cache
// update reorders the data in the same tick the drop fires, and dnd-kit's
// default would then animate each item from its pre-reorder slot to its
// new slot — which makes the row that ends up at the top look like it
// slides in from above the list. Letting the DOM snap into place after
// drop avoids that artifact; the drag transform itself smooths the move.

          Hidden at rest, unlike the pre-redesign grip which sat at low opacity
          so it could be discovered without hovering. It has to be: this cell
          now holds the row's app glyph, which fades out exactly as the grip
          fades in, and showing both at rest would stack them. The alternative
          — a dedicated gutter for the grip — costs width the profile names
          need at 200px. Discoverability is traded for the glyph deliberately;
          keyboard reorder is unaffected, since focus reveals the grip. */}
